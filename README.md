Hello World! This is Claire from Hong Kong, currently based in Toronto.

This is my first playground to practise to become a data analyst and I mainly use Python and SQL to do so. 

Project-wise, my interest is around travel, consumers, sustainability, wellbeing industry and I am aiming to analyse data in those areas.

Any comments are greatly appreciated!
